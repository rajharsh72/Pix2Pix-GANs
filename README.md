# Pix2Pix-GANs
The Pix2Pix GAN is a general approach for image-to-image
translation. It is based on the conditional generative adversarial network,
where a target image is generated, conditional on a given input image. In
this case, the Pix2Pix GAN changes the loss function so that the
generated image is both plausible in the content of the target domain, and
is a plausible translation of the input image. The Pix2Pix GAN was
demonstrated on a wide variety of image generation tasks, including
translating photographs from day to night and products sketches to
photographs.
